Scribbletune is a Node.js module that helps you construct musical ideas with JavaScript String & Array functions and export them as MIDI files. You can also use Scribbletune in the browser with Tone.js or in your terminal with the built-in CLI!

It is created with [@scribbletune/midi](https://github.com/scribbletune/midi) which is a modern rewrite of [jsmidgen](https://github.com/dingram/jsmidgen) for exporting MIDI files, [tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js) for the webaudio API and [tonal](https://github.com/tonaljs/tonal) as a dev dependency for music theory (chords and scales) via [harmonics](https://github.com/scribbletune/harmonics) and a homegrown pattern language that helps you quickly put together musical ideas. It also consists of an API to help you put together a browser based music production application.

Scribbletune is a free and open source project created & maintained by [Walmik Deshpande](https://twitter.com/_walmik). It is currently in active development thanks to it's [awesome contributors](https://github.com/scribbletune/scribbletune/graphs/contributors). The logo for Scribbletune has been graciously contributed by [Zuur Willem](https://github.com/zuurw/Graphic-Design-).
